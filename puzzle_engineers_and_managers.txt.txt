3. Is there a way to classify everybody else in fewer questions? Yes.

There's a simpler (never said easier) way to determine if the Norne Corporation is 
mostly engineers, or more mostly managers.

If it is mostly engineers, who are always assumed to know and tell the truth, then by simple probability,
more than half of the organization actually knows the truth. Wherein, by law of deduction - anyone
will be able to truthfully (no pun intended) figure out what was deleted, or covered up, over time.
Basically, if the engineers know the truth - they'll tell the truth. But if they don't know the truth,
they really don't know.

If it is mostly managers, who are to be ALWAYS assumed to lie (until they tell the truth), then by simple probability,
more than half of the organization actually knows the truth, and is willfully withholding it. Where, by law of induction -
anyone will be to truthfully (no pun intended) figure out what was delete or covered up, over time. On the simple basis of constant
interrogation until the truth has been determined by a trusted-party. Otherwise, nothing will be found - also it's illegal to delete evidence of
a crime, or intent to commit a crime. Therefore, anything that was deleted is a really, REALLY big no-no in the eyes of the law.

There's also the chance that there's managers with engineering experience - that they've disclosed or haven't disclosed. But more
likely than not, it smells like there's something fishy at the tippy top. And they're going to go to any lengths to not get
thrown in an orange jumpsuit.
